If you want a straight javascript version, you can compile it easily yourself.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n    assets = require 'connect-assets'\r\n    jsPrimer = require 'connect-assets-jsprimer'\r\n    \r\n    # Snip ...\r\n    \r\n    app.use assets()\r\n    jsPrimer assets\r\n\r\n    # Optionally, you can pass in a log function to see progress\r\n    # jsPrimer assets, console.log\r\n    \r\n### Copyright\r\n\r\nCreated by [Jacob Gable](http://jacobgable.com).
